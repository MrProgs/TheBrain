This is a project that I am worked on for my Senior Project undergraduate course. It is a simple closed-domain question answering system. Its domain is the presidential biographies that can be found on whitehouse.gov. The system utilizes Python and the NLTK and Prolog. The system is far from perfect or even fully functional, but given the amount of time I've had to work on it (A little over 3 months) I think it came along nicely.
